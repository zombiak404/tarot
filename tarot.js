Think not of this fearsome horseman as the executioner, think of him as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. This is a card of new beginnings. An old building is demolished so that a new and better one may be constructed. So also, old habits and lifestyles will be abandoned for new and better ones. Discarding past encumberances will make room for a better future. The demolition of the old and the construction of the new will not be easy or painless, but ultimately will make things better. Traditionally, transformation, mortality, destruction, deterioration. Also, in certain contexts, the Death card may represent intense sexual experiences.<br><br>Reversed:<br>Something that should die but it won\'t. A cycle should end but is wrongly perpetuated. Resisting or delaying change. Inability to move on after a tragedy. There may be an upside to the reversed meaning, though. It might represent a "Blast from the Past", something that was lost but is once again found.

Perhaps apparently unrelated influences can be made to work in unison. Traditionally, moderation, adaptability, economy, unity, discretion, management, accomodation, and of course, temperance.<br><br>Reversed:<br>Pretty much the direct opposite of upright. Out of balance. Disharmony. The attempt to merge opposite elements fails. Individuals you are working with may be uncooperative. When focusing on health issues, Temperance reversed warns of possible serious illnesses such as food poisoning or infectious diseases made worse by stress or an out of balance metabolism.

      '<p>Upright:<br>Excesses and extremes. Careless and unrestrained sexuality. Drug abuse. Alcoholism. Obsession. Perversion. Giving in to temptations. Exploring one’s deepest fantasies and desires. The Devil helps us unleash the repressed animal instincts we all have inside. Look closely at the card... This Devil is not Satan, this is Pan, the Greek Goat God of Pastures and Shepards, known for his extreme appetites. And also look at the chains around the necks of his "captives". The chains are so loose they could easily remove them. It is not by force the Devil holds them, it is by their own choice. He does not want to steal their souls, he wants to teach them to explore their inner selves. They could remove the chains and walk away at any time, but they choose to remain on the Devil’s leash. This card not only represents extremes of hedonism, addiction and self indulgence, but in some cases the opposite extremes of repression and abstinence. It is really a lesson on balance, teaching that extreme behaviour impedes achievement, progress and growth. When representing a person in a reading, the Devil is someone powerful and persuasive, likely a controller or manipulator, but also perhaps a teacher. Traditionally, violence, disease, force, drunkeness, passion, bondage, self destruction. When looking at one’s physical well being, be alert for physical or emotional abuse, addiction, or sexually transmitted diseases.<br><br>Reversed:<br>Most often, escape from the bondage of self destructive behavior. The subject is likely to realize the damage they are doing, and start down a more constructive path. Traditionally, liberation, recovery, understanding, virtue. In a few cases, though, the Devil reversed can represent succumbing totally to obsession or addiction, which explains the darker traditional meanings of pettiness, lust, bondage and bewitchment. In health matters, the Devil reversed suggests recovery from illness .</p>'

      '<p>Upright:<br>The Tower is probably the most feared card in the Tarot deck. Unexpected catastrophe. Turmoil. Upheaval. It seems likely that the authors meant to warn of consequences for the hedonism described in the Devil card. You are sitting snug and happy in your castle tower, seemingly safe from the dangers below. Suddenly, a bolt from the blue smashes into your life, casting you out of your secure world. The image on this card is quite clear. Complacency is shattered. Stability is gone. Comfort and confidence are distant memories. But in some ways this card is not entirely different from Death. It also represents new beginnings, not by choice but by necessity. The Tower card brings us back down to earth. In a few situations, it is also suggested that this lightning bolt could represent the electricity of irresistible passion or true love striking the seeker. Traditionally, calamity, catastrophe, ruin, cataclysm, punishment.<br><br>Reversed:<br>Not much better than upright. Neville Chamberlain played out the Tower reversal when he acquiesced to Adolph Hitler occupying Czechoslovakia in exchange for "Peace in Our Time". Illusions of solving the problem without really doing it. Perhaps a temporary truce, but the war goes on. You may think you have smoothed things over, but catastrophe and turmoil are waiting for you around the corner because you have not really addressed the underlying problems.

Entering the Moon’s world is frightening, but can also be revealing and inspirational. The Moon suggests creativity and intuition. Possibly psychic revelations. Utilize the inspiration. Perhaps write or paint. But also respect the dangers lurking in the dark. Beware of deceptions and phony people. The subject must be very careful to avoid hiding their fears behind alchohol or drugs, as the Moon indicates increased vulnerability to these self destructive behaviors. Traditionally, hidden enemies, deception, illusion, danger, terror, lunacy, plots, dreams.<br><br>Reversed:<br>The upright Moon is not a comfortable card, but the reversal in ways is more frightening. Although it indicates less danger of external hidden enemies and deceptions, it suggests heightened fears or denials. Perhaps overly emotional or delusional behavior. Irrational and intense fear could cause psychological problems. The wildness and chaos of the dark may be getting out of control. This is also a card of travel, in a different sort of way. It is said to sometimes portend Astral Travel, the experience of consciousness traveling outside of the body.

Sometimes suggests a marriage or childbirth. Traditionally, revelation, enlightenment, success.<br><br>Reversed:<br>Not entirely the opposite, but something obscures the clarity of the upright aspect. Refusal to open ones eyes to the possibities. Most likely this will be a temporary delay. The enthusisasm and abilities are there, but the focus is clouded. Ultimately, the clouds should clear up.

Traditionally, completion, fulfillment, perfection, promotion, honors, good health. A good omen for successful childbirth.<br><br>Reversed:<br>Not an opposite meaning so much as a delay. The tools seem to be there, but the successful completion is as of yet unattained. Perhaps fear of what lies beyond is preventing completion. Sometimes thought to represent hollow or half hearted efforts. A person with great credentials resting on their laurels. Travel may be delayed or interrupted. Combined with the wrong cards in a reading, The World reversed could represent failure or serious problems.

A lover of the finer things, but pragmatic about their acquisition. Perhaps a bit possessive about the people in his life. Steady, stable and dependable. Generous about providing guidance to others. Traditionally, courageous, intelligent, intellectual, loyal. Mathematical aptitudes.<br><br>Reversed:<br>Reversed, the King of Pentacles may become a cheapskate or an exploiter. He may be a business owner who underpays his employees, cheats on taxes or operates dishonestly. Perhaps a slumlord. He may be overly conservative, thereby impeding or preventing progress. He may view people simply as resources. Also, there may be financial problems. Mathematical aptitudes, dependability or pragmatism could be lacking. As the Pentacles represent the Earth, this reversal could suggest environmental carelessness or usury. Traditionally, vice, weakness, ugliness, perversity, corruption, disorder.</p>"

Traditionally, the subject moves on from mourning and renews connections with family and friends. The opposite interpretation is that inverted, the remaining cups are emptied and nothing is left.
